DEFCON22!
 Apocolyptic! 
 The end (or the beginning) of the (new) world as we know it!
That's the tone or feeling I sensed when viewed these videos
Not unlike a militia, conspiracy groups, "they're out to get you!", etc.
And I don't mean that in a negative or critical way.  I do understand that there ARE "powers" that be, that are running shit.
