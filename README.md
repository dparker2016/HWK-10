DEFCON22!
 Apocalyptic! 
 The end (or the beginning) of the (new) world as we know it!
That's the tone or feeling I sensed when I viewed these videos-
not unlike a militia, conspiracy groups, "they're out to get you!", etc.
And I don't mean that in a negative or critical way.  I understand that there ARE the "powers" that be, that are running shit.
AND I can, and do, appreciate, that there are individuals, and groups that are exposing this to the lay person (Me!)
These are very intelligent computer science people with an agenda....
and depending on which side you fall, defcon22 is a revoulution for the people or an anarchist rebellion!
